# To-Do-List
A to-do list can help you stay organized and focused on your tasks, making it easier to manage your time and accomplish your goals.
## How this project works?
This project can be used as a daily to-do list to manage your time and tasks. It uses localStorage to manage data, so if you refresh the browser, your tasks will still be there. This makes it easy to keep track of your tasks and stay organized throughout the day.
